As a consequence, on FrSky hardware that is perfectly capable of supporting 4 RC channels and up to 12 switch channels with an update rate of 9 ms, OpenTX (up to and including version 2.2.3 at least) only supports an update rate of 18 ms for the RC channels. To make matters worse, it does this by sending RC frames to the flight controller at intervals of 9 ms, but sends identical RC data for each pair of consecutive frames.","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Serial-BlackBox-Logging":{"id":"wiki/archive/Serial-BlackBox-Logging","title":"Serial-BlackBox-Logging","description":"OpenLog is not a suitable serial blackbox logging device for Betaflight 4.0 and beyond","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Serial-Pass-Through":{"id":"wiki/archive/Serial-Pass-Through","title":"Serial-Pass-Through","description":"Update FrSky XSR RX Firmware","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Servos-&-SERVO_TILT-for-3.1":{"id":"wiki/archive/Servos-&-SERVO_TILT-for-3.1","title":"Servos-&-SERVO_TILT-for-3.1","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Setup-for-a-Fixed-Wing-Aircraft":{"id":"wiki/archive/Setup-for-a-Fixed-Wing-Aircraft","title":"Setup-for-a-Fixed-Wing-Aircraft","description":"_If you\'re looking to fly a simple delta wing, scroll to bottom._","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Single-wire-FlySky-(IBus)-telemetry":{"id":"wiki/archive/Single-wire-FlySky-(IBus)-telemetry","title":"Single-wire-FlySky-(IBus)-telemetry","description":"It\'s now possible to combine the serial rx and ibus telemetry on the same fc uart on a single pin.","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Single-Wire-Software-Serial":{"id":"wiki/archive/Single-Wire-Software-Serial","title":"Single-Wire-Software-Serial","description":"Disclaimer:","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Soft-Mounting-and-Noise-Reduction":{"id":"wiki/archive/Soft-Mounting-and-Noise-Reduction","title":"Soft Mounting and Noise Reduction","description":"FAQ #56 has been where all the info has been put.

For example, FRSky Smartport will send a certain set of information while Crossfire will send another set.","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle":{"id":"wiki/archive/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle","title":"Tuning-Dynamic-Idle","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4":{"id":"wiki/archive/Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4","title":"Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4","description":"Notes about some new 3.4 features and defaults","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Unified-Targets":{"id":"wiki/archive/Unified-Targets","title":"Unified Targets for users","description":"- Determine the target to use.","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/VTX-CLI-Settings":{"id":"wiki/archive/VTX-CLI-Settings","title":"VTX-CLI-Settings","description":"As of Betaflight version 3.3.0, the CLI settings below can be used to","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/VTX-Tables":{"id":"wiki/archive/VTX-Tables","title":"VTX-Tables","description":"VTX Tables for Use in Configurator","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect":{"id":"wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect","title":"Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect","description":"Yaw Spin Recovery Notes","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/configurator/adjustments-tab":{"id":"wiki/configurator/adjustments-tab","title":"Adjustments Tab","description":"","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/configurator/cli-tab":{"id":"wiki/configurator/cli-tab","title":"CLI Tab","description":"BetaFlight has a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to change settings and configure the FC","sidebar":"wiki"},"wiki/configurator/configuration-tab":{"id":"wiki/configurator/configuration-tab","title":"Configuration Tab","description":"This is where most of the main configuration of your flight controller will be done.
